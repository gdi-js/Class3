	Create an object to hold information on your favorite 
	recipe. It should have properties for:
		recipeTitle (a string)
		servings (a number)
		ingredients (an array of strings)
		directions (a string)
	Try displaying some information about your recipe.
	Bonus: Create a loop to list all the ingredients.
